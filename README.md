## Project 2: Student Performance Prediction using Supervised Learning

 Key Contributions:
* Implemented Linear Regression for score prediction based on study hours.
* Visualized the dataset, regression line, and learning curve for model evaluation.
* Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared.

 
 ### Steps Involved
 
* Importing Libraries and Loading Data:
Utilized pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to load and explore the dataset.

* Visualizing the Dataset:
Created scatter plots to understand the distribution of scores with respect to hours studied.

* Data Preparation and Splitting:
Extracted independent and dependent variables and split the data into training and testing sets.

* Training the Linear Regression Model:
Utilized the scikit-learn library to train the linear regression model.

* Making Predictions and Evaluating Metrics:
Predicted scores for a hypothetical scenario and evaluated the model using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R-squared.

* Visualizing Results:
Plotted the regression line, actual vs. predicted values, and a learning curve for model evaluation.

## Results and Visualizations

1. Scatter Plot:
Showed a positive correlation between hours studied and percentage scores.

2. Regression Line Plot:
Displayed the best-fit line indicating the linear relationship between hours studied and scores.

3. Learning Curve:
Visualized how the model's performance evolves with the addition of training examples.

### Metrics and Evaluation
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 4.18
* Mean Squared Error (MSE): 21.60
* R-squared: 0.945


## Conclusion
The linear regression model demonstrates a strong performance in predicting student scores based on study hours. The visualizations and metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities. Further exploration and refinement could enhance the model's predictive power.
